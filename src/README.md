# Angular, NodeJS, MongoDB Customers Service

This project provides a look at getting started using Angular Http functionality and how it can be used
to call a Node.js RESTful service.  

## Angular Concepts Covered

* Using TypeScript classes and modules
* Modules are loaded with System.js
* Using Custom Components
* Using the Http object for Ajax calls along with RxJS observables
* Performing GET, PUT, POST and DELETE requests to the server
* Working with Angular service classes for Ajax calls
* Using Angular databinding and built-in directives

## Software Requirements To Run Locally (there's a Docker option below as well)

* Node.js 6.10 or higher
* MongoDB 3.2 or higher

### Running the Application Locally

1. Install Node.js (6.10 or higher) and MongoDB (3.2 or higher) on your dev box

    * Node.js: https://nodejs.org
    * MongoDB: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation

1. Execute `mongod` to start the MongoDB daemon if it's not already running

1. Install Nodemon and Gulp: `npm install nodemon gulp -g`

1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

1. Run the following Gulp task to copy required Angular modules into the `public` folder: 

    `gulp copy:libs`

1. Run `npm start` to compile the TypeScript and start the server

1. Browse to http://localhost:3000

## Running the Application with Docker

1. Install Node.js (6.10 or higher) and Docker for Mac/Windows or Docker Toolbox - https://www.docker.com/products/overview

1. Open `config/config.development.json` and change the host from `localhost` to `mongodb`

1. Install Gulp: `npm install gulp -g`

1. Run `npm install`

1. Run `gulp copy:libs`

1. Run `npm run tsc:w` to compile TypeScript to JavaScript locally (leave the window running). This is only needed when in "dev" mode.

1. Open another command window and navigate to this application's root folder in the command window

1. Run `docker-compose build` to build the images

1. Run `docker-compose up` to run the containers

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 if using Docker for Mac/Windows or http://192.168.99.100:3000 if using Docker Toolbox in a browser
